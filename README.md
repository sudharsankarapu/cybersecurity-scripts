# Cybersecurity Scripts

This repository contains custom scripts I have developed to automate various cybersecurity tasks, including vulnerability scanning, log analysis, and penetration testing.

## Scripts Overview
1. **Vulnerability Scanner (Python)**  
   - Automates scanning for common vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, and Open Ports.

2. **Log Analyzer (Bash)**  
   - Parses server logs to detect anomalies and potential security incidents.

3. **Brute-Force Testing (Python)**  
   - Tests password strength and login endpoints for brute-force resistance.

## Disclaimer
These scripts are for educational and testing purposes only. Always use them responsibly and with permission.
